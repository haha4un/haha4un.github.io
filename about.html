<p>It's hard to say something concrete about me, but I'll try.</p>

<h4>Coder</h4>
<p>First of all, I'm a <b>coder.</b> I love programming and I hope my life will be connected with it. So, my competitions in programming (let's name that coding) are: Kotlin (Android developing), python (algorithms). And I wish to know a web (I will learn it, I swear).</p>

<h4>Languages learner</h4>
<p>The second thing to read about me that I'm love learning languages! Unfortunately, I'm able to speak only on two languages and those are Russian and English. But I have another one to learn in my wish-list: Esperanto.</p>

<h4>Lover of Mathematic</h4>
<p>Yep, I've written this, but my Math-skills are quite ordinary. Overall, I know that math is very useful thing in every area of society and I also swear to become better in math.</p>
